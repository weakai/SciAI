# DeepAVP

## Ideas

Dual-Channel

Variable-Length Antiviral Peptides

AVPs

## Dataset

Well-established dataset: Nishant _et al_.

4 AVPs dataset: (AVPdb APD3 CAMPR3 LAMP) + 452 non-effective AVPs
-> CD-hit(90%)
-> AVPs: 413 vs 348

## Models

Joint Module = LBLSTM + CONV

### CONV

20*20 Blosum Matrix, PSSM Matrix
Fine-Tuned Kernel on CONV Channel

### Comparison

Different Models on Nishant's Dataset
Existing Predictors on the Novel Dataset
