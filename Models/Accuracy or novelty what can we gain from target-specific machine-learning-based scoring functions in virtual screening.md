## MLSFs 

Machine-learning (ML)-based scoring functions  

Applications:

- protein–ligand binding affinity prediction 
- structure-based virtual screening 

## LIT-PCBA dataset



## 	VS

- ligand-based VS (LBVS) = QSAR modeling + similarity searching （similar molecules are more likely to possess similar bioactivities ）
- structure-based VS (SBVS)

## models

classical Glide SP SF and three types of
ligand-based quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) models  

## words

However, clouds of doubts have still been raised against the benefits of this novel type of scoring functions (SFs).
